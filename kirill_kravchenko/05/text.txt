The owners of the Zaandam, Holland America, said that more than 130 people on board had reported 
suffering "flu-like symptoms" and respiratory issues.
Nobody has left the ship since it docked in Chile two weeks ago.
Holland America said it planned to transfer passengers to a sister ship.
The Zaandam and the Rotterdam are both off the western, Pacific coast of Panama.
The Zaandam is trying to sail to Florida. But the Panamanian authorities have said no vessel with 
confirmed coronavirus cases on board can pass through the Panama Canal.
